# Example file

This is an export from a fraudulent Defi scam. It is only the beginning of the chat and is a  very typical (pig-butchering)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_butchering_scam] scheme.

# Usage

To convert this export to html do the following:

```
python ../whatsapp_converter.py -o defi-html WhatsApp\ Chat\ -\ DeFi\ Farming\ Club\ V3.zip
cd ../defi-html
```

This will create a folder called `defi-html` in the repositories root folder.
